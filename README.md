# gleipner

This repository is currently a template for the gleipner project.

This project is based on the PhD thesis "A Framework for Facilitating the Set-up of Industrial Pose Estimation Systems" and the paper "Does vision work well enough for industry?".

There is currently an ongoing Bin-Picking project funded by the SDU i4.0 laboratory. This project will expand on gleipner.
